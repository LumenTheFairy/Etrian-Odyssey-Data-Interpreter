Some things to bare in mind if you are reading through this documentation.

-I have only looked into EO3 and EOU myself. As such, exact sizes and use of various parts of files may change
 in other games. The meaning of values for these parts is almost certainly different in most cases.
-The names for parts of the data I have named myself or borrowed from others. They shouldn't be considered official,
 and may not match different names you've heard or used elsewhere.
-I am a notoriously poor speller. I'll just apologize for all of the typos there are sure to be.
