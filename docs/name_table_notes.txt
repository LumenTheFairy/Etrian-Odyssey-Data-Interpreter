Name tables in EO store a list of strings that can be indexed into.
The characters of the string are EOchars, and thus must be translated to be readable.

Depending on how many indices are in the list, the size of the indices may be 2 bytes or 4 bytes long.
(I'm not sure where this is stored, but I imagine it's somewhere in the filesystem.)
Let width be the size of the indices.

The files have three parts, the size, a string pointer list, and the string data.

part   offset           size                 name          description
0      0x0              width bytes          size          determines how many strings are stored in this table
1      width            (size*width) bytes   string pos    a list of pointers to the next string in the list (*)
2      (size+1)*width   variable             string data   the string data, separated by null bytes (**)

Notes:
 * these pointers are offsets from the start of the string data
   the first string is assumed to start at offset 0
   the last pointer in this list will point to the end of the file
** the string characters need not be short aligned


You can convert an EO name table to a readable tsv with `unpack_EO_name_table.py`. To run, see:
$   ./unpack_EO_name_table.py -h
for its usage.
