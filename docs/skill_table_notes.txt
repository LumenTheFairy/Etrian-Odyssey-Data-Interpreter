Skill tables in EO store all of the information associated with a set of skills.

The size of a skill's information is fixed, so the file itself is just the list of skills
without any header or index information.

The data for a single skill has two parts, a header and a list of level data.
The header contains information for the type, usage, target, effects, etc. for a skill.
The level data has a set of parameters to the skill that may change as level increases
(for example, how much damage it does, how accurate it is, etc.)

There are a fixed number of rows to the level data, and a fixed number of levels, but these vary by game.
For example, EO3 has 8 rows with 10 levels each, whereas EOU has 10 rows with 15 levels each (to account for boost.)
Let these be lv_rows and num_lvs respectively.

Skill_Data:
name         type                      offset   size
header       Skill_Data_Header         0x0      0x18 = 24 bytes
level data   Level_Data_Row[lv_rows]   0x18     2 * lv_rows * (num_lvs+1) bytes

Skill_Data_Header:
name                 type      offset   size (bytes)   description
ukn1                 ?         0x00     1              ?
skill_type           u8        0x01     1              The broad type of the skill
usage_requirements   bit[16]   0x02     2              The body part and/or weapon required to use the skill
unk2                 ?         0x04     2              ?
target_type          u8        0x06     1              How this skill targets (single, all, line, etc.)
target_team          u8        0x07     1              Which team this skill targets (i.e. friend, foe, both)
unk3                 ?         0x08     1              ?
buff_kind            u8        0x09     1              Subtype for buff skills (buff, debuff, clearing, etc.)
buff_type            u16       0x0A     2              Which stat or stats a buff affects
buff_damage_type     bit[16]   0x0C     2              Which damage types are affected by a buff
damage_type          bit[16]   0x0E     2              The damage types of an attack skill
ailment_skill_type   u16       0x10     2              Subtype for ailment skills (i.e. none, cause, heal)
possible_ailments    bit[16]   0x12     2              Which ailments can be affected
unk4                 ?         0x14     4              ?

Level_Data_Row
name     type           offset   size (bytes)   description
tag      u16            0x00     4              Tag saying what the values in this row affect
values   u16[num_lvs]   0x02     num_lvs        The values for each level, increasing up from level 1

The meaning of a value in any header field, or tag in a level data row, mostly differs by game.
A very incomplete list can be found in dictionairies in `eo_value_lookup.py`.
(I believe other's have more complete understanding of the header fields and value meanings;
I haven't spent a ton of time on this structure.)


You can convert an EO name table to a readable tsv with `unpack_EO_skill_table.py`. To run, see:
$   ./unpack_EO_skill_table.py -h
for its usage.
